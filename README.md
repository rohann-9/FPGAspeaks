# FPGAspeaks
FPGA speaks is a community created to experience and share knowledge on Verilog HDL which is the basic domain of VLSI.

We will work in Three Levels on this and prepare a LaTeX documentation on this at the end of each level.

This Repository is created to present my work on Verilog Programming in the Three levels.
